# ProductFlavours
A project that uses flavours to show how to build an application with the Zebra EMDK for a range of devices from JellyBean to Marshmallow and beyond.  Accompanies blog post https://darryncampbellblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/deploying-an-application-to-zebra-android-devices-ranging-from-jellybean-to-marshmallow-and-beyond/

## Note: You must extract the EMDK Jar file avialable from the EMDK installation to the app\lib\emdkX.0 directories for both EMDK5 and EMDK6.  Licensing restrictions prevent me hosting these files on GitHub
